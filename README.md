This project was part of a group assignment in my Software Design class, where we were tasked with building a GUI-based Java application for a YorkU Library Management System. The purpose of this project was to learn how to design software from scratch, following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

In this group project, my role was to handle the core functionality and logic of the system, focusing on implementing the backend features, while my group members focused on developing the GUI and conducting testing to ensure the system met the project requirements.

Below is an image listing the requirements addressed in the project, and linked is a YouTube video explaining how each requirement was met.
