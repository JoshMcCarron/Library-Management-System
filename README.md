This project was part of a group assignment in my Software Design class, where we were tasked with building a GUI-based Java application for a YorkU Library Management System. The purpose of this project was to learn how to design software from scratch, following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Below is an image listing the requirements addressed in the project, and linked is a YouTube video explaining how each requirement was met.
